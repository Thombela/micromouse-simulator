# micromouse-simulator
A MATLAB/Simulink-based simulator for developing and testing maze-solving algorithms in a virtual micromouse robot. This project mimics real-world micromouse competitions by simulating sensor inputs (ToF, photodiodes), robot dynamics, and environmental challenges like sensor noise and wheel slippage.
